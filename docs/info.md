## How it works

This project takes button press for input to advance the count of the flip flop counter as a binary representation over 3 LEDs. 

## How to test

Test the project by pressing the button many times and seeing if the 3 LED outputs count up by 1 in binary from 0 to 7.

## External hardware

A push button and 3 LEDs.
